<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways. You can provide different value propositions to different customer groups. Customer segments are usually determined on similarities, such as personal characteristics, preferences or behaviours that should correlate with the same behaviours that drive customer profitability. The main aim of this problem is learning the purpose of the customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis, trying to understand customers and sepparate them in different groups according to their preferences, and once the division is done, this information can be given to marketing team so they can plan the strategy accordingly. 

Here's why:
* To become more profitable, you need to be able to differentiate your customers to more effectively satisfy the needs of the different segments.

Dataset is available at [link](Dataset/Mall_Customers.csv)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* Marketing efficiency – Breaking down a large customer base into more manageable pieces, making it easier to identify your target audience and launch campaigns to the most relevant people, using the most relevant channel.
* Determine new market opportunities – During the process of grouping your customers into clusters, you may find that you have identified a new market segment, which could in turn alter your marketing focus and strategy to fit.
* Better brand strategy – Once you have identified the key motivators for your customer, such as design or price or practical needs, you can brand your products appropriately.
* Improve distribution strategies – Identifying where customers shop and when can informatively shape product distributions strategies, such as what type of products are sold at particular outlets.
* Customer retention – Using segmentation, marketers can identify groups that require extra attention and those that churn quick, along with customers with the highest potential value. It can also help with creating targeted strategies that capture your customers’ attention and create positive, high-value experiences with your brands.
